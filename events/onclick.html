<title>Event listener invoking order</title>
<pre>
Since listeners are called in the order they were registered,
the order of event listeners for a particular event type will always
be first the event listeners registered with addEventListener()
before the first time the event handler was set to a non-null value,
then the callback to which it is currently set, if any, and finally
the event listeners registered with addEventListener() after the
first time the event handler was set to a non-null value.
</pre>
<button id="test">Start Demo</button>
<script>
  var button = document.getElementById('test');
  button.addEventListener('click', function () { alert('ONE') }, false);
  button.onclick = function () { alert('THREE'); };
  button.addEventListener('click', function () { alert('TWO') }, false);
</script>
