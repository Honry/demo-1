# Description

This is to collect and improve the demos of interaction between src and srcset
on the mailing list:

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html-ig-zh/2013Oct/0037.html

Perhaps this is also used to collect more demos of the srcset attribute
specified as an HTML extension for adaptive images:

* http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#the-img-element
